At Google they’ve made a commitment to hiring more diverse people, encouraging and incentivising Black people to recommend more of their friends and family who they think are good enough to work at the company."</p>

                        <p>"From my perspective, they’re a big enough organisation to always be seen to be doing the right thing at the right point in time. When there were BLM protests after George Floyd, emails went round and the CEO made a comment. There was even a company-wide call. But it’s always reactionary. There’s nothing proactive. They’re not going out of their way to show that they care about these causes in any way. It’s always a response to be seen to be doing the right thing rather than to be doing it off their own back."</p>

Many of those times, the CEO issued a corporate statement within the company giving us support and letting employees know they can take time off if things are bothering them. He reiterated that the company doesn’t stand for anything that was said by the president and it won’t be tolerated in the company. There were also times where an employee made a one-off racist comment during company gatherings and they were always immediately terminated."</p>
